## SOC-LVL-1-Journey-
Im starting this after completing the blue team intro and soc team intervals modules so starting from the third module which is core soc solutions 
### **Day1-->** 
## **SOC Solution started**
Explored what is an EDR, some common edrs, how it works, how its used and looked at its interface -- did an activity where i investigated an alert on EDR 

Learned about logs, what is a siem and how to use it.

I learned about splunk and how to add data to it and played with it a little bit 
### **Day2-->** 
I did an activity on tryhackme called introduction to phishing where i had to: 
1. Monitor and analyze real-time alerts.
2. Identify and document critical events such as suspicious emails and attachments.
3. Create detailed case reports based on your observations to help your team understand the full scope of alerts and malicious activity.
### **Day3-->** 
I did Elastic Stack: The Basics room i liked it better than splunk and practise the soc simulation with elastic stack
